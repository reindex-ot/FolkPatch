**FolkPatch** is an extended non-parallel branch based on [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch), only through optimizing the interface design and extending the features, without introducing new core functions.

# Main Features

- APM: Supports a Magisk-like module system, with batch flashing for greater efficiency
- KPM: Supports kernel-injectable modules (providing kernel functions `inline-hook` and `syscall-table-hook`)
- Removed the auto-update feature for a more stable user experience
- Enhanced system customization with support for custom wallpapers
- Fully automated KPM loading mechanism, no need to embed into Boot
- Full module backup, allowing you to enjoy Root access with peace of mind
- Multiple featured language styles for on-demand switching
- Global module exclusion for faster operation
- Online module download functionality
